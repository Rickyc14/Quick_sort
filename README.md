# Quick_sort
A classical sorting algorithm in C++ that takes input from the user like the number of elements and the elements themselves. 

The core concept of a quick sort is really simple. After computing all elements to be sorted, any given one of them will function
as a <strong>pivot</strong>. Once the pivot is selected, all elements that are bigger than the pivot will be moved to the right, and all elements 
that are smaller than the pivot will be moved to the left. After that, this process is repeated recursively until the list of elements
is sorted correctly.
